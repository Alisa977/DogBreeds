			The Tibetan Mastiff known as Drog-Khyi (འབྲོག་ཁྱི) in Tibetan, which means "nomad dog",
			("dog which may be tied", "dog which may be kept"), reflects its use as a guardian of herds, 
			flocks, tents, villages, monasteries, and palaces, much as the old English ban-dog 
			(also meaning tied dog) was a dog tied outside the home as a guardian. However,
			in nomad camps and in villages, the Drog-Khyi is traditionally allowed to run loose at night. 
			This dog is known for its loyalty, it has been used as nomad dog by Tibetan nomads for thousands
			of years.The guardian type from which the modern Tibetan 
			Mastiff breed has been derived was known across the ancient world by many names. 
			Bhote Kukur in Nepali as bhote means someone from Tibet and kukur means dog. 
			The Chinese name for the breed is 藏獒 (Mandarin: Zàng áo; Cantonese: Tzong ngou), 
			meaning "Tibetan Mastiff-dog".Tibetan Mastiff 
			from Ukraine 77 cm rise
			The name Tibetan Mastiff is a misnomer; the Tibetan
			Mastiff itself is not a true Mastiff. The term "mastiff" was used by the 
			Europeans who first came to Tibet because it was used to refer to nearly all large
			dog breeds in the West. Early Western visitors to Tibet misnamed several of its breeds: 
			The "Tibetan Terrier" is not a terrier and the "Tibetan Spaniel" is not a spaniel.
