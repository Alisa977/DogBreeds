			The Dobermann to most of the world, (German pronunciation: [ˈdoːbɐman ˈpɪnʃɐ]), or Doberman 
			Pinscher as it is known in the US and Canada, is a medium-large breed of domestic dog originally
			developed around 1890 by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann, a tax collector from Germany.
			The Dobermann has a long muzzle and stands on its toes (not the pads) and is not 
			usually heavy-footed. Ideally, they have an even and graceful gait. Traditionally, 
			the ears are cropped and posted and the tail is docked. However, in some countries
			it is illegal to do so. Dobermanns have markings on the chest, paws/legs, muzzle, 
			above the eyes, and underneath the tail.
			Dobermanns are well known as intelligent, alert and tenaciously 
			loyal companions and guard dogs. Personality varies a great deal 
			between each individual, but if taken care of and trained properly 
			they tend to be loving and devoted companions. The Dobermann is driven,
			strong and sometimes stubborn. Owning one requires commitment and care,
			but if trained well, they can be wonderful family dogs. With a consistent 
			approach they can be easy to train and will learn very quickly. As with all 
			dogs, if properly trained, they can be excellent with children.
