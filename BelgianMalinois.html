		The Malinois /ˈmælɪnwɑː/ is a medium-to-large breed of dog, sometimes classified as a 
		variety of the Belgian Shepherd dog rather than as a separate breed. The name "Malinois" is 
		derived from Malines, the French name for the breed's Flemish city of origin, Mechelen.
		The breed is used as a working dog for tasks including detection of odors such as explosives, 
		accelerants (for arson investigation), 
		and narcotics; tracking humans for suspect apprehension in police work; and search 
		and rescue missions. The U.S. Secret Service uses Belgian Malinois to guard the grounds of 
		the White House.The Malinois is a medium-to-large and square-proportioned dog in the sheepdog family.
		The Malinois has a short mahogany coat with black markings. 
		It has black erect ears and a black muzzle. It has a square build in comparison to the 
		German Shepherd.
